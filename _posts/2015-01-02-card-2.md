Worked on Dynamics AX on the Telemetry team.  Created a system to detect trends and anomalies in near-real time.  Created custom .NET activities to run in Azure Batch for use in Azure Data Factory pipelines.  Learned to use new tools and resources quickly and effectively.  Worked with people across many teams in order to gain insights and ensure the success of my deliverables.
